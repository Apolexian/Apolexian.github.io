I am a currently a PhD student at the University of Glasgow under the supervision of Dr Colin Perkins and Dr Ornela Dardha. 
I focus on using formal methods to improve network protocol specifications and the network protocol standardisation process. 
Before this, I completed my undergraduate at UofG in June 2022, with my final year dissertation analysing QUIC as a transport layer for IoT devices, specifically as the transport layer for the MQTT protocol.

Much of my work has involved low level systems code and my main programming language of interest is Rust.
Outside of this I primarily work on fullstack in Java/Kotlin and React.

You can take a look at my [CV](../assets/Ivan_Nikitin_Resume_SE.pdf) if you are interested in my work.

Outside of work I am trying to improve my songwriting, vocals and guitar. You can find me on Discord (sj9xc) if you want to chat about non-work activities.
