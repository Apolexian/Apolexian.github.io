    I am a currently a PhD student at the University of Glasgow under the supervision of Dr Colin Perkins and Dr Ornela Dardha. I focus on using formal methods to improve network protocol specifications and the network protocol standardisation process. Before this, I completed my undergraduate at UofG in June 2022, with my final year dissertation analysing QUIC as a transport layer for IoT devices, specifically as the transport layer for the MQTT protocol.

  <p>Much of my work has involved low level systems code and my main programming language of interest is Rust. Outside of this I primarily work on fullstack in Java/Kotlin and React.
